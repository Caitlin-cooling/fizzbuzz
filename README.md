# Fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzz is an interactive game, when passed a number it will:
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.
* In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.
